-handle deleting projects better...make it so that project exists and can be accessed but is no longer current?

-figure out pie chart on audition-index page
-adjust directors & CDs audition-index page to apply js & card functionality

-alphabetize indexes

-remove select user error after each failed attempt

-if project doesn't have auditions, dont shot div border in My Auditions for directors/CDs
